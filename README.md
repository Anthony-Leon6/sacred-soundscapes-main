# Welcome to Sacred Soundscapes

SacredVis is a smart audio-reactive visualizer that transforms desktop audio, microphone input, and live sound into living, vibrant visuals. Powered by a built-in Music Brain and Color Brain, it doesn’t just flash lights to beats — it understands rhythm, tone, mood, and emotion, and responds with colors and shapes that feel alive.

🧠 Music Brain – Detects rhythm, melody, and dynamics for fluid, expressive visuals.

🔮 Mood Modes – Choose between flowing geometries, pulsing beats, meditative waves, and more.

🖥️ Fullscreen or Windowed – Use as a performance tool, streaming backdrop, or daily art piece.
